h1. Tabulatr Demo

This rails app is merely a demo for the <a href="https://github.com/provideal/tabulatr" target="_blank">Tabulatr</a> gem by Peter Horn and Ren&eacute; Sprotte of <a href="http://metaminded.com" target="_blank">metaminded</a> and <a href="http://provideal.net" target="_blank">provideal</a>.

h2. What's in here?

* Examples mainly on the formatting options are in <tt>app/views/products/index_formatting</tt>.
* in <tt>app/views/products/index_fancy</tt> you'll find an bells-and-whistles example.

Some of the more _boring_ views are direct copies of the <tt>spec/dummy_app</tt> in tabulatr itself.
